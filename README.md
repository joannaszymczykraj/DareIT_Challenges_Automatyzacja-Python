## Task 1: The Software configuration
### Subtask 1: Why did I decided take part in Dare IT Challenge project?

At the beginning of 2023, I decided to change the industry. The choice fell on a software tester. I started self-study, got the ISTQB certificate and participated in several testing congresses. I really feel like doing this and it's my objective for this year. A few months ago I took part in the Challenge Manual Tester project. I decided that the course was very valuable and taking into account the situation on the testing job market, I decided that participation in the Automated Tests + Python Challenge would be a good step. I hope that I will learn new things, broaden my horizons, gain experience necessary to apply for my first job as a software tester.
