## Task 1: The Software configuration
### Subtask 1: Why did I decided take part in Dare IT Challenge project?
<details>
<summary>Click here to see general information about <b>Subtask 1</b></summary>
At the beginning of 2023, I decided to change the industry. The choice fell on a software tester. I started self-study, got the <b>ISTQB certificate</b> and participated in several testing congresses (for example <b>Test:Fest</b>). I really feel like doing this and it's my objective for this year. A few months ago I took part in the <b>Manual Tester Challenge</b> project. I decided that the course was very valuable and taking into account the situation on the testing job market, I decided that participation in the Introduction to Automated Testing + Python Challenge would be a good step. I hope that I will learn new things, broaden my horizons, gain experience necessary to apply for my first job as a software tester.
